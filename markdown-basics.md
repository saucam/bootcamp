# Markdown Basics

    Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write. It is often used for formatting plain text and is widely supported in various platforms, including GitHub, Stack Overflow, and more.

1. **Headings**

   Use `#` to create headings. The number of `#` symbols indicates the level of the heading.

   ```markdown
       # Heading 1
       ## Heading 2
       ### Heading 3
   ```

2. **Text Formatting**

   ```markdown
   - Bold:
     - **Bold Text**
   - Italic:
     - _Italic Text_
   ```

3. **Lists**

   ```markdown
   Unordered List:

   - Item 1
   - Item 2
     - Subitem

   Ordered List:

   1. First Item
   2. Second Item
   ```

4. **Images**
   ```markdown
   ![Logo](https://example.com/logo.png)
   ```
